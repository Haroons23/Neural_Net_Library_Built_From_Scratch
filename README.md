# An Artificial Neural Network library build from scratch using numpy. 

Description: For this specific project it was used to classify electromyography test results. 

ToDo:
- Just needs to get cleaned up and packaged, everything is there. 

Implemented Features Include:
- Custom number of hidden layers and nodes per hidden/input/output layer.
- Forward & Back propagation.
- Early stopping to prevent over fitting. 
  - Also reverts weight values during training if performance decreases significantly. 
- Data preprocessing and cross validation steps.
- Testing steps.
